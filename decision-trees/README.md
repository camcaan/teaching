# Tree-Based Methods
This repo accompanies a lecture I gave for University of Colorado Boulder's [Advanced Data Analysis course (CVEN 6833)](http://civil.colorado.edu/~balajir/CVEN6833/) taught by Balaji Rajagopalan in Fall 2018.

## Lecture Materials
There is a lot of information on decision trees, so instead of reinventing the wheel, I've followed the [slides](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/c4x/HumanitiesScience/StatLearning/asset/trees.pdf) from Chapter 8 of [An Introduction to Statistical Learning: with Applications in R](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/). Which, by the way, is *free* to download. The authors have also created [great videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5-da3qGB5IB23TLuA8ZgVGC8hV8ZAdGh) for these slides and hands-on R tutorials. Code for the labs can be found [here](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/code.html).

If you want more **code**, you're in luck. [@asadoughi](https://github.com/asadoughi/) has created a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/asadoughi/stat-learning) which contains the unofficial answers to the exercises in the book. **If you are looking for the exact code I presented in class, check out [my fork of the repo](https://github.com/wraseman/stat-learning/blob/master/ch8/lab.R).**

## Other Resources
Although the above information should be enough to get you through CVEN 6833, below are some other resources I've found helpful:
- R2D3: provides a solid **intuition** for decision trees without any equations or code
  - [A visual introduction to decision trees (part 1)](http://www.r2d3.us/visual-intro-to-machine-learning-part-1/)
  - [A visual introduction to decision trees (part 2)](http://www.r2d3.us/visual-intro-to-machine-learning-part-2/)
- Mathematical Monk: he's got a whole [YouTube series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDLKJtOVx5c&list=PLD0F06AA0D2E8FFBA) related to Machine Learning and a bunch of videos on decision trees. He references [The Elements of Statistical Learning](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/ESLII.pdf) which is by the same authors as the book mentioned above, so the material should be closely related. Check out his videos for nice lectures on the **theory** behind these methods (without the code).
