# Hidden Markov models
This repo accompanies a lecture I gave for University of Colorado Boulder's [Advanced Data Analysis course](http://civil.colorado.edu/~balajir/CVEN6833/) (CVEN 6833) taught by Balaji Rajagopalan. 

The lecture walks through Markov processes and hidden Markov models and illustrates their use regarding phenomena with persistence: time series with long-term positive autocorrelation.

The following are contained in this repo:
+ Lecture: lecture_hmm.pdf
+ R script: code_hmm-nile-river.R
+ Html of R script output: code_hmm-nile-river.html
+ R script code_hmm_lees-ferry.R (warning: this example did not work. I'm still trying to make sense of why that was the case)
+ data: any data required by R scripts
